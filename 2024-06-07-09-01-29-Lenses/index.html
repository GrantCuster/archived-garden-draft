        Thinking about things that make you see the world around you
        differently: ARGs, birding, mushroom hunting, simulating physical
        phenomena in code, drawing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was listening to the
        <a
          href="https://eggplant.show/139-sticking-to-your-systems-with-animal-well"
          >Egglant podcast interview with the Animal Well maker</a
        >
        and they mentioned "secrets in plain sight" in the game and compared it
        to ARGs, where your street becomes something new/different to you
        because there is a geocache (or pokemon station there).
      </p>
      <p>
        That made me think about
        <a href="https://x.com/blprnt/status/1798698976495235307"
          >a tweet I saw yesterday from Jer Thorp</a
        >
        about how birding helps you to see more details around you. Someone else
        mentioned taking up mushroom hunting had a similar effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've thought about this when trying to simulate physical phenomena in
        code like water or raymarching, causes you to most closely observe the
        physical world.

        A classic example of this is drawing, where one of the best instructions
        I got from the art teacher was that you had to look at something how it
        actually looks, not how you think it looks.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favorite explorations of this idea is China Mieville's The
        City {content}amp; the City, where two cities are overlaid on top of one
        another and living in one is a process of ignoring the other.
