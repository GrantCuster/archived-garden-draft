        This blog!: I want to get preview images working. I'm trying to generate
        them using cairo, so I can do it as part of the build script. I would
        say I've proven out the basic concept, now need to decide on some text
        positioning and hook it all together for the first run.

        Mini PC: I'm working on getting a mini PC set up with the my current
        go-to Ubuntu server + Nix home-manager config. Eventually I want to try
        and make it a wearable deck to go with my AR glasses. Will write about
        that more later.
