        Pokemon took the combat formula from traditional turn-based RPGs and
        turned it inside-out.
      </p>
      <p>
        In traditional RPGs you have a few characters who learn more and more
        attacks and spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Pokemon you capture more and more characters (pokemon) who can only
        have four moves each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of choosing from a big list of attacks and spells, you choose
        from a list of Pokemon and then a small list of moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in the shift from "few characters, many moves" to "many
        characters, few moves each" as a design move that could be useful to
        apply to interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many traditional RPGs (I've been playing Chrono Trigger) are recognized
        as some of the best videogames ever made, but they don't rival pokemon
        in popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        How much can you put that difference down to the shift in combat? There
        are definitely some other, related aspects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Capturing means regular battles are now opportunities to create more
          characters. Regular battles are the grindiest aspects of RPGs so this
          seems like a big deal.
        </li>
        <li>Evolution mechanics tap into people's interest in digital pets.</li>
      </ul>
