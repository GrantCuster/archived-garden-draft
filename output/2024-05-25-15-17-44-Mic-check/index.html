        Today I made this blog / garden. I want it to be a place where I can
        write quickly and with focus.

        Right now it's a bunch of bash scripts that put together some templates.
        I wanted to know exactly what was going on so that I'll be able to
        modify it in the future. Though to be transparent the bash scripts were
        AI assisted. Still, I think I understand all the steps.
