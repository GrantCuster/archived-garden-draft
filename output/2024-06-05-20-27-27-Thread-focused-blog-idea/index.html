        What if I made a blog like this blog but also more like Twitter. Where I
        could make little posts, or I could also reply to old posts, bumping
        that 'thread' of posts to the top. But (like Twitter) it would show the
        update, with an indication and ability to click through to see the full
        thread.

        That seems kind of cool? Like it'd be good for long-running thoughts I
        keep returning to and also for WIP posts...

        Maybe structuring stuff in the code gets weird, but it's going to be
        small-scale so I think I could figure something out. I think I'd just do
        markdown files with like a link at the top, and use the filename for the
        date slug like I've been doing. I would still like titles I think. But
        maybe that's just otional.
