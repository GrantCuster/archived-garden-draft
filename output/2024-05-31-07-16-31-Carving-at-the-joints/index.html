      <p>
        I've always liked building systems where the joints are visible: legos,
        Minecraft. Lately I've been thinking about the process of learning how
        to find the joints in systems where they're less visible. I've been
        thinking of it as 'carving at the joints'.

        I guess it originates with Plato, who said "carving nature at the
        joints". I think my recent reference is the show Delicious in Dungeon,
        where they explain how to cut and prepare dungeon monsters into unlikely
        meals. The show has a lot of fun with the instructions reveal, where
        something that looks inedible is made appetizing through a precise set
        of steps.

        With projects I've been thinking about this with electronics. Compared
        to something like woodworking, electronics seems harder to tell where
        the joints are -- and the joings are the opportunities for you to
        modify, to splice in or replace parts. But as you try a few projects,
        and watch the YouTube DIY examples, you start to see.

        For computerr projects you can start with the components that are
        actually sold separately. Screen, computer, battery, keyboard and mouse.
        I've got a kind of portable cyberdeck going now with a Mini PC, a
        battery, a set of AR glasses and a keyboard. A laptop broken into it's
        parts and rearranged.

        I've also partially disassembled some laptops, removing a broken display
        and instead routing it to a monitor for a 'headless' laptop. I've
        accidently disconnected the Wifi antenna and needed to add it back in --
        a process which makes more concrete to me the wifi antenna as a piece of
        tech.

        I like the idea of 'looking for the joints' when I approach a system.
        I've been thinking about this even with AI model experiments. Models are
        a weird set of capabilities, I want to find the right set of
        capabilities and splice them together with other software pieces to make
        the creative experiences I'm after.
