        I want to make sure I can write from anywhere, including my work mac,
        which I'm writing on now. I had to update bash on the mac (I did it
        using Nix home manager). Otherwise things seem to be working well.

        Edit: also had to replace a <code>grep P</code> with a <code>sed</code>.
