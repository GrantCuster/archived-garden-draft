      <p>
        Trying to keep up the habit of quick writing in here. Now morning
        writing from the couch, the dog beside me, the baby exploring a
        cardboard box. A nice spring-like morning.

        Did some organizing syncing the setups yesterday. Still liking the
        Ubuntu + Nix configuration. Getting better and faster about keeping it
        up to date across the laptop and the mini PC. The server's a bit behind.

        For the glassese set-up I got audio and bluetooth working yesterday, so
        I think everything I wanted to do with that thing is proved out. I
        ordered a cross-body bag that I hope will fit everything well. Porch use
        has been good so far, interested in trying a commute with it. The
        battery pack has been working well, I'm surprised how much having an
        exact percent readout, rather than something like 4 lights, helps me
        feel secure about power draw.

        I want to get clipboard history sorted today. Also want to make the nice
        gif recording set up with a notification in the top bar.
