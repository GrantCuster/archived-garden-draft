        I'm not sure if it was from reflashing the keyboard firmware or
        resetting the computer software but it's working now. It is nice. I'm
        not sure what lesson to take from this.

        Am I writing too many posts now? Still getting a feel for this thing. It
        is fun the ways different writing environments seep into the writing.
