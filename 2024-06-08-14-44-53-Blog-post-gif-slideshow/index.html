        Seeing the OG images I generate for this blog has me thinking. If you
        split a blog post by paragraphs and generated PNGs, and then you
        stitched those into a GIF with the frame time based on text length...
        that would maybe be a portable / embeddable blog post? Not good for
        accessibility and not to replace the post, but maybe an interesting
        derivative.
