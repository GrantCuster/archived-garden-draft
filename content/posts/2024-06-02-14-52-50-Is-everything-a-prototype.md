# Is everything a prototype?

Prototypes shouldn't look too nice. They should look like a work-in-progress. They should [show their joints](2024-05-31-07-16-31-Carving-at-the-joints.md).

This keeps discussion at the right level of abstraction. You want to be talking about the capability, not the color scheme.

It also invites others to extend and modify the prototype in their mind. It encourages iteration.

## Is everything a prototype?

I believe in and make these arguments.

As I make the case, I start to question, what work shouldn't have these qualities?

Shouldn't all work invite understanding and potential modification?

Should everything be a prototype? Is everything a prototype?

I think this connects to that Steve Jobs quote about the empowerment of un
derstanding everything in the built world was designed by someone, and you can do it too.

Probably qualities that might be in conflict with prototypey-ness are durability and safety. Important things!

But I think a lot of objects aspire to a feeling of 'completeness' that is uneccesary. That feels like it's designed to conceal its own construction and I think I want to move counter to that.
